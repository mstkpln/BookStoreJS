                INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER - Named a Best Book of April 2021 by - AV Club - Bustle -
                Entertainment Weekly - Good Morning America - Chicago Review of Books - Fortune - TIME - CNN Underscored

                Magazine - Glamour
                From the indie rockstar of Japanese Breakfast fame, and author of the viral 2018 New Yorker essay that
                shares the title of this book, an unflinching, powerful memoir about growing up Korean American, losing
                her mother, and forging her own identity.
                In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more
                than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of
                the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular,
                high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny
                apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food.
                As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and
                performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her
                Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her
                mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her
                identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.
                Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is
                onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying
                in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.

            <p>
                A New York Times Bestseller
                A Washington Post Bestseller
                Named a Best Essay Collection of the Decade by Literary Hub
                As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of
                science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals
                are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together
                to take us on "a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical,
                as clever as it is wise" (Elizabeth Gilbert).
                Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living
                beings--asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass--offer us
                gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the
                creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a
                central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and
                celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear
                the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn
                to give our own gifts in return.</p>

            <h1>Yoke: My Yoga of Self-Acceptance</h1>
            <h3>Jessamyn Stanley</h3>

        <div class="column">
            <p>
                Finding self-acceptance both on and off the mat.
                In Sanskrit, yoga means to "yoke." To yoke mind and body, movement and breath, light and dark, the good
                and the bad. This larger idea of "yoke" is what Jessamyn Stanley calls the yoga of the everyday--a yoga
                that is not just about perfecting your downward dog but about applying the hard lessons learned on the
                mat to the even harder daily project of living.
                In a series of deeply honest, funny autobiographical essays, Jessamyn explores everything from imposter
                syndrome to cannabis to why it's a full-time job loving yourself, all through the lens of yoke. She
                calls out an American yoga complex that prefers debating the merits of cotton versus polyblend leggings
                rather than owning up to its overwhelming Whiteness. She questions why the Western take on yoga so often
                misses--or misuses--the tradition's spiritual dimension. And reveals what she calls her own "whole-ass
                problematic" Growing up Baháí, loving astrology, learning to meditate, finding prana in music.
                And in the end, Jessamyn invites every reader to find the authentic spirit of yoke--linking that good
                and that bad, that light and that dark.

            <h1>How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America</h1>
            <h3>Clint Smith</h3>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>Instant #1 New York Times bestseller. "The Atlantic writer drafts a history of slavery in this country
                unlike anything you've read before" (Entertainment Weekly).
                Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of
                monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an
                intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation's collective history, and
                ourselves.
                It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote
                letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the
                story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience
                of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former
                plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the
                18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting
                place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers.
                A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries
                of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country's most essential stories
                are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as
                Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in
                enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted.
                Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith's debut work of
                nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role
                that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.</p>

            </p>From the New York Times bestselling author of Red, White & Royal Blue comes a new romantic comedy that
            will stop readers in their tracks...
            For cynical twenty-three-year-old August, moving to New York City is supposed to prove her right: that
            things like magic and cinematic love stories don't exist, and the only smart way to go through life is
            alone. She can't imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird
            roommates could possibly change that. And there's certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything
            more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.
            But then, there's this gorgeous girl on the train.
            Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft
            smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August's day when she needed it most. August's subway crush
            becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there's one big problem: Jane doesn't just
            look like an old school punk rocker. She's literally displaced in time from the 1970s, and August is going
            to have to use everything she tried to leave in her own past to help her. Maybe it's time to start believing
            in some things, after all.
            Casey McQuiston's One Last Stop is a magical, sexy, big-hearted romance where the impossible becomes
            possible as August does everything in her power to save the girl lost in time.

            <p>"Sure to be one of the best memoirs of 2021." --Kirkus Reviews, starred review</p>

            <p> "So clear, sharp, and smooth that the reader sees, in vivid focus, Ford's complicated childhood,
                brilliant mind, and golden heart. Ford is a writer for the ages, and Somebody's Daughter will be a book
                of the year." --Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Untamed</p>

            <p> "Ford's wrenchingly brilliant memoir is truly a classic in the making. The writing is so richly observed
                and so suffused with love and yearning that I kept forgetting to breathe while reading it." --John
                Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author</p>

            <p> One of the most prominent voices of her generation debuts with an extraordinarily powerful memoir: the
                story of a childhood defined by the looming absence of her incarcerated father.
                Through poverty, adolescence, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley Ford wishes she could
                turn to her father for hope and encouragement. There are just a few problems: he's in prison, and she
                doesn't know what he did to end up there. She doesn't know how to deal with the incessant worries that
                keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her body that draw unwanted attention from men. In
                her search for unconditional love, Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates. When the relationship
                turns sour, he assaults her. Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley
                desperately searches for meaning in the chaos. Then, her grandmother reveals the truth about her
                father's incarceration . . . and Ashley's entire world is turned upside down.
                Somebody's Daughter steps into the world of growing up a poor Black girl in Indiana with a family
                fragmented by incarceration, exploring how isolating and complex such a childhood can be. As Ashley
                battles her body and her environment, she embarks on a powerful journey to find the threads between who
                she is and what she was born into, and the complicated familial love that often binds them.</p>
